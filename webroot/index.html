            <div class="description">
                The amount of experience I've picked up at Imgur is astounding. I've contributed to practically every part of the stack working with technologies including Varnish, HAProxy, Nginx, PHP, Memcache, Redis, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Flume, Kafka, MapReduce, Hadoop, and HBase, EC2, S3.
                <br/>
                I've lead the planning and execution of various projects such as image analytics, search, gifv, notifications, A/B testing frameworks, API, video processing pipelines, event pipelines, followers, etc. 
                <br/>
                I've worked closely with desktop, mobile web, Android, and iOS clients to design new and RESTful APIs.
                <br/>
                I've also architected notifications, image analytics, video processing, stream processing, and various other systems to scale to hundreds of millions monthly users, and I created Imgur's image analytics data pipeline which supported over 5B daily events and processed them for offline and real-time access.

            <div class="description">
                I've also managed Imgur's small team of highly-motivated engineers. I worked with the engineers to help find their passions, mentor, and help solve engineering problems. I worked closely with high level executives to meet deadlines and company goals. Interviewed several engineering candidates, reviewed resumes. Was in charge of successful execution of backend projects while being a contributor.

            <div class="description">
                I worked on OCLC's full text search engine, written in C, that powers all
                of its products. I added new features, fixed bugs, and provided production support.
                Then I worked on a migration project to move OCLC away from Oracle and into HBase.
                I implemented MapReduce jobs, and created tools to monitor and manage our Hadoop stack.
                We open-sourced some of those tools.
